      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>
 
This project focuses on classifying soil types using image data and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It involves loading a dataset of soil images, performing data augmentation to improve model generalization, building a CNN model with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers, training the model to classify the images into distinct soil categories (Alluvial, Black, Clay, and Red), and evaluating its performance on a test set. The trained model is then saved for future use in soil classification tasks.
